This data analysis is to analyze the ToothGrowth data set by comparing the guinea tooth growth by supplement and dose. First, I will do exploratory data analysis on the data set. Then I will do the comparison with confidence intervals in order to make conclusions about the tooth growth.
Loading the ToothGrowth data and analysis
---------------------------------------------------------------


library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
str(ToothGrowth)
head(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)

Plot for the simulation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
library(ggplot2)

t = ToothGrowth

levels(t$supp) <- c("Orange Juice", "Ascorbic Acid")

ggplot(t, aes(x=factor(dose), y=len)) + 
  facet_grid(.~supp) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp), show_guide = FALSE) +
  labs(title="Guinea pig tooth length by dosage for each type of supplement", 
    x="Dose (mg/day)",
    y="Tooth Length")
    
Hypothesis #1
The box plots seem to show, increasing the dosage increases the tooth growth. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orange juice & ascorbic acid deliver the same tooth growth results.
hypoth1<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = t)
hypoth1$conf.int
hypoth1$p.value
The confidence intervals includes 0 and the p-value is greater than the threshold of 0.05. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

Hypothesis #2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the dosage of 0.5 mg/day, the two supplements deliver the same tooth growth.
hypoth2<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(t, dose == 0.5))
hypoth2$conf.int
hypoth2$p.value
The confidence interval does not include 0 and the p-value is below the 0.05 threshold. The null hypothesis can be rejected. The alternative hypothesis is accepted.

Hypothesis #3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the dosage of 1 mg/day, the two supplements deliver the same tooth growth
hypoth3<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(t, dose == 1))
hypoth3$conf.int
hypoth3$p.value
The confidence interval does not include 0 and the p-value is smaller than the 0.05 threshold. The null hypothesis can be rejected. The alternative hypothesis that 1 mg/day dosage of orange juice delivers more tooth growth than ascorbic acid is accepted.

Hypothesis #4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the dosage of 2 mg/day, the two supplements deliver the same tooth growth
hypoth4<-t.test(len ~ supp, data = subset(t, dose == 2))
hypoth4$conf.int
hypoth4$p.value
The confidence interval does include 0 and the p-value is larger than the 0.05 threshold. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

Conclusions & assumptions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orange juice delivers more tooth growth than ascorbic acid for dosages 0.5 & 1.0. 
Orange juice and ascorbic acid deliver the same amount of tooth growth for dose amount 2.0 mg/day. We cannot conclude orange juice is more effective that ascorbic acid.

Assumptions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal distribution of the tooth lengths
No other unmeasured factors are affecting tooth length
